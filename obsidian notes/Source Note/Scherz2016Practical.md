## Notes

#### How Op-amp works?
> "By itself, an op amp's operation is simple. If the voltage applied to the inverting terminal V - is more positive than the voltage applied to the noninverting terminal V + , the output saturates toward the negative supply voltage -V S . Conversely, if V + > V - , the output saturates toward the positive supply voltage +V S (see **Fig.**  below). This "maxing out" effect occurs with the slightest difference in voltage between the input terminals." ([Scherz 2016:664](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WMPQQ98V?page=664))

#### Negative Feedback
> "When voltage is "fed" back from the output terminal to the inverting terminal (this is referred to as negative feedback), the gain of an op amp can be controlledâ€”the op amp's output is prevented from saturating" ([Scherz 2016:665](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WMPQQ98V?page=665))

> "As you can see from this equation, if you increase the resistance of the feedback resistor, there is an increase in the voltage gain. On the other hand, if you decrease the resistance of the feedback resistor, there is a decrease in the voltage gain" ([Scherz 2016:665](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WMPQQ98V?page=665))

#### Positive Feedback
> "Positive feedback has the opposite effect as negative feedback; it drives the op amp harder toward saturation. Although positive feedback is seldom used, it finds applications in special comparator circuits that are often used in oscillator circuits."
